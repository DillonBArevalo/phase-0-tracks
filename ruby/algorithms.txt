Elevator Algorithm:
1. check what floor you are on .
2. ask what floor the rider wants to go to.
3. find button that corresponds to floor instruction. 
4. push button.
5. wait until elevator doors open.
6. exit elevator

In this elevator algorithm I'm making a few assumptions:
 *the robot can ask for and receive/understand directions (what floor you want to go to)
 * the robot can see what floor they are on (some elevators there is a screen that displays it, some elevators the button is lit)
