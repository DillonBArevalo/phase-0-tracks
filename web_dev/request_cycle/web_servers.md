I read an article on linux philosophy and the takeaway that i got was the line "respect all users." the implication was to give users as much power as possible to do whatever they want with the machine. don't try to protect them and thus limit them. 

I also found "nine major tenets of the linux philosophy."
they are as follows (from: https://opensource.com/business/15/2/how-linux-philosophy-affects-you)

Small is Beautiful 
Each Program Does One Thing Well
Prototype as Soon as Possible
Choose Portability Over Efficiency
Store Data in Flat Text Files
Use Software Leverage
Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability
Avoid Captive User Interfaces
Make Every Program a Filter

use software leverage means lean on the work of others who have contributed. don't remake the wheel.

filter programs means that it takes a standard input, modifies the data in some way and then makes a standard output. the rest are pretty self explanatory.

a VPS (virtual private server) is a mini computer that is run remotely (or just in its own little pocket so it can't mess with the outside). they are super useful to try stupid things in and have no consequences. you can also practice creating any environments you want without worrying about the data on your computer.
