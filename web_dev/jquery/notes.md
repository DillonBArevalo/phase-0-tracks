I'm going to watch a few videos first to get an idea of how jquery works. I can watch them in fast forward and thus get a very quick idea of things. Beyond that I want to look at documentation a lot. 

I want to test things often in small ways but largely only if i don't understand (or can't find good) documentation.

definitely going to take breaks as i want to stay focused.


notes:

watching videos was a good start. it oriented me well to what i was working with and pointed me towards greater resources. i was also able to watch at 2.5 times speed which greatly sped up the process. it didn't teach me much in the end, but was a good introduction.

I did find the documentation and it had tutorials which i checked out. I went through the basics, coding along. then i modified the code and moved it to other files and messed with things until i was clear i understood everything. 

didn't take much of a break as i was interested and didn't feel my concentration wane much.
