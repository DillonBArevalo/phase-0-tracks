I'm going to watch a few videos first to get an idea of how jquery works. I can watch them in fast forward and thus get a very quick idea of things. Beyond that I want to look at documentation a lot. 

I want to test things often in small ways but largely only if i don't understand (or can't find good) documentation.

definitely going to take breaks as i want to stay focused.
