    <h1> Otters </h1>
    <p>Otters are <strong>like</strong> cats, but they live in the water. They're <em>water cats</em>! Some people think seals are water dogs, but otters are water cats.</p>
    <p>Just like cats they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>playful</li>
      <li>adorable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are many types of otters, but the two I've most often heard referred to are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>river otters (there is more than one type of river otter)</li>
      <li>sea otters</li>
    </ol>
